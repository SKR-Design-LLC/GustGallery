      <p>Born in Germany into an artistic family, Karin has had a passion for painting since she was a child. She has been a professional artist for more than 20 years with a style that can be described as impressionistic. Her subjects are varied and she enjoys working in watercolour, oils, acrylics and pastels.</p>

      <p>Karin completed her professional training in foreign languages, worked as a translator and interpreter in France and Germany and eventually moved to Montreal in 1973. Calgary has been home to Karin and her family since 1977. She draws inspiration not only from the western landscape and the Canadian Rockies close at hand but also from international destinations she travels to on a regular basis. Throughout the years, Karin's paintings have been featured in solo and group shows in many prominent locations and private and public galleries locally, nationally and internationally. Sharing her knowledge of painting has been a joy to Karin for many years. She is an enthusiastic art instructor to many aspiring artists in classes and workshops in Calgary and across Canada. She has become known as the traveling artist and leads groups on painting holidays on land and at sea in Canada and Europe.</p>

      <p>An elected member of the Canadian Society of Painters in Watercolor (CSPWC), the Alberta Society of Artists (ASA), the Society of Canadian Artists (SCA) and Pastel Artists Canada (PAC) with a Master Pastellist designation (MPAC), Karin has received many awards including the Immigrant of Distinction Award in 2010 for her contributions in the art community. Karin's work has appeared in several trade publications and is included in the Biennial Guide to Canadian Artists in Galleries and in Canadian Artists at Auction. She is featured in the book entitled &ldquo;How Did You Paint That &mdash; Seascapes, Rivers and Lakes&rdquo; published by the International Artist Magazine. Her paintings can be found in corporate and private collections all over the world.</p>
