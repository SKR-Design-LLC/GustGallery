      <p>Glassblower Barbara Rumberger takes elements of earth and fire and combines them to make ethereal works of art that reveal the mysterious through light and color.</p>

      <p>Barbara began her art journey in art glass over twenty years ago in the Visual Communications program at Alberta College of Art and Design (ACAD). In her first year, a glass elective sparked a passion for her. She switched majors to glass in her second year.</p>

      <p>Using techniques honed over the years in the studio, Barbara crafts unique glass objects such as curvy vases, delicate flowers, and intricate paperweights. Barbara creates through the force of gravity, using the angle of her pipe and the mastery of her breath. She combines thinly layered colors and thick clear glass to showcase the dynamic optical beauty of the medium. This layering creates a stunning textural depth that defines Barbara's distinctive style.</p>
