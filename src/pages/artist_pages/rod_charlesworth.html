      <p>
          Born in Northern British Columbia, Rod Charlesworth moved to the Okanagan at a young age. The Surrealists influenced his earliest works. He then discovered the works off the Impressionists, which provided him with his current artistic interests, including his keen interest in experimenting with colour and the physical properties of paint. Charlesworth follows in the footsteps of artists such as Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven.
      </p>
      <p>
          Charlesworth's work is now collected worldwide. His work continues to be exhibited throughout the country. He remains committed to creating images that have a strong and distinct Canadian cultural influence. Whether this is expressed through his bold landscapes or his recent whimsical images of children at play, his viewers find a connection with each of his works of art.
