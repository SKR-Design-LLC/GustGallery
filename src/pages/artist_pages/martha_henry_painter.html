              <p>I have been a glass blower for over 30 years. I graduated from Sheridan College School of Art and Design, Ontario, and later moved to Calgary, Alberta to work as an artist in residence for Canada's first sheet glass company, designing and creating stained glass windows for residential and commercial clients. Three years later, I decided to return to my first passion, glass blowing and built three glass studios over time. My glasswork evolved as I experimented extensively with sand blasting and copper electroplating. I took workshops in the U.S. and Murano, Italy, honing my skills in flameworking, creating detailed figures and intricate glass beads that I designed into jewelry. The process I most love working with is the use of 24K gold and silver leaf applied on hot glass or gilded.</p>

              <p>I did a lot of travelling in Europe, Mexico and other parts of the world for research and pleasure. It was during this time that I became interested in painting, being exposed to historical masterpieces and exhibitions of contemporary international artists. Inspired by these works of art, I eventually transformed my hot glass shop into my painting studio. I live and work in the beautiful Rocky Mountains of western Canada and I am inspired by the majestic landscape around me. Every discipline of work I have attempted to master over the years has influenced how and what I paint. I have taken various workshops with acclaimed artists, but for the most part I am self taught. In some of my wetland series, I try to capture the luminescent light and reflection with the use of gold and silver foil.</p>
