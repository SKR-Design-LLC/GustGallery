      <p>Heather Dodd was raised on a ranch near Lundbreck, in the southwest corner of Alberta.</p>
      <p>
        With her love of nature and the outdoors she is well suited for her lifestyle of farming and a market gardening business called "Room To Grow" that her and her husband Norman now operate in Glenwood, Alberta.
      </p>
      <p>In the winter months, when the garden is asleep, Heather finds time for her passion, to paint. The medium she works most in are acrylics and watercolor, but does not confine herself to just those and is often trying other ventures using pastels, oils and pencil. Heather has attended several short workshops, but is basically self-taught. Inspiration for he detailed work, comes from nearby. The unequaled scenery in southern Alberta, farm experiences, garden flowers and most important her family, all lend to getting those artistic ideas flowing.</p>
      <p>Heather belongs to several local art groups where everyone encourages each other and it is a great environment for learning about art.</p>
      <p>Heather loves to use color and detail to make the viewer a little more aware of the intricacies of nature.</p>
