        On March 17, 2020 I was laid off work due to the pandemic.  I felt very isolated.  I looked for an activity to complete everyday.  It was early spring in Southern Alberta, so I spent part of my time watching for the birds that were returning to the yard during migration.  I decided to paint the birds as I saw them.  On one side of my living room, the wall space is long and windowless, so I chose this to serve as a canvas.  For seventy days straight, I painted one life-sized bird a day on my living room wall.  I began posting each bird daily on social media. The birds served as brilliant facilitators, providing the much&mdash;needed interactive link between myself and fellow artists, birders, friends and even my own family.  Five months later, I am now pleased to report that my birds are officially migrating to canvas!
