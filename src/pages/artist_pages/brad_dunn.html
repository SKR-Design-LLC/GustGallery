<p>Brad is a 4 year graduate of the Grant McEwan Art College in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>

<p>Upon leaving school he has pursued many different areas in the art world including graphic design and fine art. However, moving to Southern Alberta, he has found a passion for sculpting the indigenous animals that are native to this part of the province, including the grizzly and black bear, as well as various birds of prey such as the eagle. Southern Alberta has proven to' be an inspiration' for Brad in the creation of <br>new and unique sculptures that represent this region and show how nature can be brought into the lives of people from near and far.</p>
