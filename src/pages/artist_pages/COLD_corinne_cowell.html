  <div class="artist_bio__title">Artist Statement</div>
    <p>I have always been interested in narratives and they are a recurring theme in my work. Some of the areas I've been interested in are about personal memories as well as identity and place.</p>

    <p>My current work continues my interest in narrative specifically as it relates to the environment and our place within it as well as our transitions through it. I work in multiple media and image sets simultaneously and my current directions include our intimate experience in wild spaces, fleeting moments in relation to time of day, year and era as well as interactions with the natural world.</p>

    <p>I specifically like the textural and sculptural aspect of the needle felt work as it simulates the undulations and dimensional aspects of the images I'm creating. They become more of a living and tactile environment, encouraging the viewer to touch and reminisce.</p>
    â€‹
    <p>I also use wet and needle felting, acrylic painting, and mixed media collage as a base for story telling. I greatly enjoy exploring new media and it's interplay with the subject because I want the materials to be integral and supportive of the stories I'm trying to portray. I am also intrigued by the textural and mixed media potential of the materials I use on both a visual and emotive level. The materials I use can range from raw wool, paint, photo transfer, hand made and printed papers to acrylic paint, hand stitching and horse hair.</p>

    <h3>Artist Biography</h3>
    <p>Corinne Cowell is a mixed media artist who was born in Toronto, Canada. She received her BFA from the Alberta College of Art and Design (now the Alberta University of the Arts) and her work is retained in many collections both commercial and private.</p>

    <p>She is an award winning graphic designer and fine artist. After pausing to raise her young family, in 2010 she decided to refocus almost entirely on fine art and fine craft. She discovered a love of fibre in 2011 and has been developing and refining her technique in order to create a unique style of presentation for her fibre and felted work.</p>

    <p>Her current work deals with narratives and memories as well as the environment and our place within it. She uses whatever media supports her imagery and theme ranging from needle and wet felted wool, acrylic paint and photography, water colour and ink, to silk, paper, and horse hair to express her visual stories.</p>

    <p>She has exhibited her paintings and fibre pieces in many shows and is currently working on several private commissions. Corinne lives and works in Calgary, AB.</p>
