    <p>Roberta Murray, ASA was born in Calgary, Alberta but now makes her home in the country southwest of Rocky Mountain House. This location works together with her deep love of nature and the land, to inspire her work.</p>

    <p>Working mostly in oils, Roberta strives to produce evocative paintings that allow the viewer to create their own stories or interpretations. Her main focus is on impressionist landscapes with a special emphasis on big skies, which is a nod to both her great great uncle Frederick Cross, and the many years she has spent as a volunteer weather watcher for Environment Canada.</p>

    <p>Roberta is a juried member of the Alberta Society of Artists, Federation of Canadian Artists, and Oil Painters of America. Her works reside in private collections across North America and the United Kingdom.</p>
