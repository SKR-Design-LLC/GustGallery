      <p>Brenda Banda Johnson Fine Art features a collection of bold, textured palette knife paintings that reach out from the canvas and invite you into the scenes they portray - both real and imagined. Every piece you find here is an original. I paint almost exclusively with large palette knives, and find vibrant &amp; high contrast colour palettes irresistible.</p>

<h3>About My Work</h3>
      <p>My work is inspired by the stunning beauty and energy of nature. I am irresistibly drawn to both its' complexity and its' simplicity, the perfection in its' imperfection, and the stillness in the chaos of it. I am especially drawn to the beautifully flawed bark of trees - scarred, peeling and cracked; lush, vibrant foliage; sculptural chunks of driftwood worn smooth by time and the elements; wild, stormy skies; jagged mountain peaks and rocky outcroppings stained by centuries of watershed, rich with minerals. You will find these themes repeated often in my work.</p>

      <p>With my palette knife, loads of acrylic paint and thick gel mediums I attempt to capture the depth and textures of nature that intrigue me. I tend to use an &quot;exaggerated&quot; colour palette. The majority of my paintings are vibrant and exaggerated beyond what you'd literally see in nature, attempting to capture not just the visual image, but also it's energy and life. The other extreme is subtle neutrals that are all about shadow, light and texture. I occasionally use pouring mediums or a high gloss resin finish - sometimes in the traditional manner and sometimes very selectively to highlight certain elements of a painting. The result is a collection of highly textured pieces that reach out from the canvas and invite you into the scenes they portray.</p>

<h3>About the Artist</h3>
     <p>I grew up on a farm in Saskatchewan, in a landscape of rolling hills, thick forests, warm swimming lakes, wild flowers and wide open skies. A move to Calgary many years ago brought me near the mountains I love so much, and the outdoor pursuits that go with them. Nature has always been a place of centeredness and peace for me, a source of energy and vitality, and has always felt like &quot;home&quot;.</p>

     <p>In 2010 I started &quot;playing&quot; with acrylic paints as a hobby, experimenting with various brushes, paints and mediums. When I discovered palette knives and the textures and depth I could create with them, my passion for painting truly ignited. I have been painting every chance I get ever since, and it is now my full-time work. Not surprisingly, landscapes are my primary subject matter.</p>
