      <p>Born in 1959 in New West Minster, Jerry has always shown an interest in art and enjoyed putting pencil to paper to create sketches as a young boy. In 1997, he moved his young family to Alberta, putting art aside as he worked his career and raised a family.</p>
      
      <p>Motivated by a trip to Canmore to browse art galleries many years later, Jerry took up painting in 2019 only to realize how much he still enjoyed creating art and exploring new techniques of doing so. He is dedicated to realism in each piece he creates and works with acrylic paint on birch board, telling a story through each commission.</p>
