      <p>
        Optimistic by nature, enjoying the colour of life, seeing the sunny side figuratively and literally makes that I am inspired by colour like the colourists and impressionists. I am generally drawn in by art from artists who use a lot of colour, have abstracted their scenes, but are still realists like Cameron Bird, Nicholas Bot, Brent Laycock, Kim Hunter, Erica Hawkes, Julie de Boer and Erica Neumann for instance. In my mind I always follow the shape and line of things. This combination shows in my work. I love abstracting a subject to the point that it is still realistic although also not really realistic. I usually work in acrylics and oils, and am inspired by the natural environment. I mostly choose to paint landscapes, trees, florals and animals.</p>

        <p>I cannot go outside without being intrigued by the beauty surrounding us and showing itself in so many different ways. The way the light hits and creates a special atmosphere not only in large areas but also in tny litle niches captvates me. I am mesmerized by it and it makes me happy. Intrigued by what goes on in an animal I often choose to present them as portraits. Alberta is blessed with a multitude of gorgeous critters and breathtaking landscapes which I love to explore in every season of the year.</p>

        <p>My style can be defined as a kind of graphic realism. I enjoy exaggerating on the brightness of colour to produce a cheerful image. I hope to make people connect with it, smile, not take things too seriously and to enjoy life. I believe that the gift of creativity has been entrusted to me to share my positivism with others. A painting can be a beautiful daily reminder of our blessings.</p>

        <p>I presented work at the Calgary Stampede Art Gallery for several years, the Venture Art Gallery, Art on 9th Gallery, Leighton Art Centre, Lineham House Galleries and Okotoks Art Gallery in Okotoks.</p>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>
