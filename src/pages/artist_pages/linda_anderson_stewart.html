      <p>Linda Anderson Stewart works from a studio in her home on a small ranch, located north of Waterton National Park, Alberta, Canada. Her paintings are a reflection of the varied natural beauty in which she encounters on a daily basis.</p>

      <p>With an honors B.F.A from the Alberta College of Art and Design in Painting 1990, Linda has worked the last 22 years to develop her skills in a variety of mediums. Her mission is to best express how the natural world's colour and light affect her.</p>

      <p>Her move to Waterton area was a much needed catalyst. By immersing herself in this unique and much loved environment, she recognized and embraced her strong need for a sense of place. Her work now encompasses the entire range of her visual experiences there &mdash; from the large sky and landscape expanses to the smallest of wild flowers, hidden deep in the grass &mdash; all are parts of the whole that complete her world.</p>
