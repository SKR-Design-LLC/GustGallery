      <p>
        The paintings by Canadian artist, Cecile Albi, are the result of her search for meaning and understanding of her natural environment. After an in&mdash;depth relationship with visual art, Albi has intuitively constructed a fluid visual language, in which to engage conversation with nature, herself and the viewer. Her visual picture plane often supports the &lsquo;beautiful&rsquo;, yet at anytime, may change into and reflect the unstable and unpredictable traits of our planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Skillfully utilizing compositional elements, Albi follows Nature&apos;s lead through the use of colour, shape and movement. She plays with the acts of assembling and dismantling &mdash; by implementing order and surrendering to chaos. Echoing and respecting the offerings made by the Impressionists, Cubists and Abstract Expressionists, Cecile Albi brings her own fresh unrestrained mark to the Contemporary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cecile Albi&apos;s works of art peak a full range of emotions and thoughts, from the serene to the awe inspiring, stimulating curiosity for the mind and the spirit.
