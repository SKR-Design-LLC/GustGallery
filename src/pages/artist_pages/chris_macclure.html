<p>Chris is always looking for that authentic gesture or moment in everything. His paintings are an expression of his &quot;Romantic Realist&quot; view of life, not crafty nor painterly. Born into an artistic family in St. John, New Brunswick on the east coast of Canada, Chris was surrounded by the arts from a young age. His father was a jazz musician and mother a playwright, His grandfather was an illustrator, so it never occurred to him that he couldn't do it. He assumed everyone was an artist. This sense of inner confidence has taken Chris to places and studios around the world for more than 40 years. During his travels he attended Sir George University (Concordia) Fine Arts in Montreal Canada and the Emily Carr School of Art &amp; Design in Vancouver Canada. His works have been exhibited across Canada, the US, Mexico and Hong Kong. Numerous paintings of his may be found in many corporate collections worldwide. Some collectors include, John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, James Whitmore, mezzo soprano Frederica Von Stade, drag racing legend Don Prud'Homme , Bill Clinton, Pepsi Co. and the Ford Motor Co. of Detroit , and recently the Duke &amp; Duchess of Cambridge (Will &amp; Kate) He is the founder of &quot;International Artist Day&quot; A special day held worldwide each Oct 25th to honor all artists. As an international Canadian artist Chris spends some of his time in Cabo San Lucas in Baja, Mexico for some of the winter months and is a White Rock artist.</p>
