    <p><em>&ldqou;My work is elemental, with a focus on nature and the forces with which humanity has to contend. I search for a distinctive atmosphere from the immensity and grandeur of the plains to the human mark etched upon it. With both a plaintive and expressive palette of light and movement I draw both from my past, a process I call &ldqou;Memory Polaroids&rdqou;, and from the present day of all that surrounds me. My medium is oil on canvas&#8230; and a guitar.&rdqou;</em></p>

      Steve's work triggers the feeling of familiarity, that somewhere at sometime the viewer has seen or felt this, an intimate mystery that lives on the tip of the tongue. It's accessible for simply what it is, a painting or a song left to a person's interpretation.
