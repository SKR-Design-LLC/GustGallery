      <p><em>&ldquo;My work is elemental, with a focus on nature and the forces with which humanity has to contend. I search for a distinctive atmosphere from the immensity and grandeur of the plains to the human mark etched upon it. With both a plaintive and expressive palette of light and movement I draw both from my past, a process I call &ldquo;Memory Polaroids&rdquo;, and from the present day of all that surrounds me. My medium is oil on canvas... and a guitar.&rdquo;</em></p>

      <p>Steve Coffey has been an integral part of the Canadian art and music scene for many years. He has curated traveling exhibitions, created large&mdash;scale public sculptures, taught college, and conducted many workshops and art residencies. After finishing his formal training in 1990 with an MFA Steve practiced formalist metal sculpture but eventually gave in to his love of drawing and representation and was seduced by the immediacy and challenges of oil paint. He began exploring the medium full time in 1995. Steve has exhibited extensively and his paintings can be found in numerous private and public collections throughout North America, Europe &amp; Asia and he is represented in Canada and United States by many well known art galleries.</p>

      <p>Steve's Music has received critical acclaim over the course of ten albums to date and he and his band have performed regularly and been heard on many radio airwaves over many years, from commercial to college to frequencies in between.</p>

      <p>Steve's work triggers the feeling of familiarity, that somewhere at sometime the viewer has seen or felt this, an intimate mystery that lives on the tip of the tongue. It's accessible for simply what it is, a painting or a song left to a person's interpretation.
