      <p>Inspired by landscape and imagination, Diana Zasadny blends the boundaries of impressionist interpretation and abstraction in her paintings. Taking advantage of light and brilliant color observed in nature, elements are distilled into atmospheric tapestries. Diana's artwork expresses the joy of being in nature through the rich, color buoyant in her canvases.</p>

      <p>Diana's unique style is achieved using many layers of acrylic paint and varnish on canvas. She paints both in her studio and en plein air.</p>

      <p>Diana Zasadny lives and paints in southern Alberta where she was born and raised. She graduated from the Alberta College of Art and Design in 1991. Her paintings are inspired by excursions in the deserts, prairies and mountains in Canada and the US. Diana's artwork has been exhibited in North America and internationally and is part of many private and corporate collections.</p>
