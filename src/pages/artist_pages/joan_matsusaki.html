    <p>
              I have always been a maker. From my earliest memories, I've always wanted to express myself through art. After taking a pottery class through the City of Calgary recreation program, I fell in awe with clay. The art of ceramics is boundless, and I consistently strive to explore different possibilities for new forms, designs, and techniques. One of my favorite techniques is sgraffito because it lends itself well to my love of drawing and printmaking.</p>
              <p>My influences and inspirations come from many different sources, but most significantly, nature inspires my work. I am happiest when I am immersed in nature, and hopefully, some of that happiness is transferred to the users of my wares. My love of nature is poured into the process of making each pot. I am blessed to be able to spread this love through the everyday use of my pottery.</p>
              <p>My studio and home are in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, and I am always amazed with the ideas that come to me after a walk in the hills or just enjoying a cup of coffee and looking out my window. I have a Fine Art Degree from the University of Guelph and a Ceramics Certificate from Sir Sandford Fleming College in Haliburton, Ontario. I have been potting since 2002.</p>
