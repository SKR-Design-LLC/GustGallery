      <p>
        Making pots for me is about creating something useful and communicating to the user what inspires me and what I find beautiful. My influences and inspirations come from many different sources - but most significantly wilderness landscapes and the animals that live in them inspire my work. I am happiest when I am immersed in nature and hopefully when someone purchases my work they are taking some of that happiness with them.

      <h3>Artist Biography</h3>
      <p>
        I have a Fine Art Degree from the University of Guelph and a Ceramics Certificate from Sir Sanford Fleming College. I have been potting since 1999.  Currently I reside in the foothills south of Bragg Creek, Alberta and work out of my studio at home.
