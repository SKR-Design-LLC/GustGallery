      <p>Distinctive application of texture &amp; intriguing use of colour with acrylic paint on large scale canvas, conveys my connection with nature,] ands what defines my Artwork.</p>

<p>I use these elements to create depth &amp; dimension that are tactile and bring my images to life in ways that invite you to reach out and touch them, as if in that moment, you can experience the feeling that inspired the painting.  My unique use of texture &amp; colour draws attention to what I want people to notice in my painting and elicits the emotions I want to share and hope you will connect with.</p>

<p>I am drawn to painting mountain scapes of hikes that are exceptional &amp; memorable to me. I strive to find a balance between an artistic impression, and reality, which gives me freedom with my brush to lose myself in the moment of the experience, rather than replicating the details of a photograph.</p>

<p>I am also passionate about painting wildlife to express the connections I have with people that are important to me. The animals I choose to create always capture the essence of relationships and memories that I hope others can relate to. For example, the painting &quot;Blue Remembers You&quot; captures a comforting soothing memory of my Mom. I am hoping that when you view my wildlife artwork it will draw a fond memory of your own, for you to savour.</p>

<p>My insightful use of texture, multiple layers of fine detailed brush strokes and an abundance of shades of colour laid with intent, bring my animals to life. I prefer to create my images on a larger canvas because this allows me to relive the moments and memories of the person who has inspired the painting. In my animals, I prefer to paint in vibrant colours because I am trying to create something as unique and individual as the person who inspired the Artwork.</p>

<p>&quot;Be fearlessly authentic. Bravely be you&quot;<br />Michele...</p>
