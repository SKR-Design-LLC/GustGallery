    <div class="artist_bio__title">Artist Biography</div>
    <p>Growing up in the Millarville area south of Calgary, Marney’s artistic journey started as far back as she can remember. Sculpting with plasticine and drawing were a few of the simple childhood activities that seeded her passion to create. She enrolled in any art classes available including attending art camp at the Leighton Centre where she eventually became a camp leader teaching kid’s art classes.</p>
<p>Marney attended the Alberta College of Art majoring in ceramics and graduated with distinction. She is currently working as a full-time artist in her studio south of Fort Macleod where she and her husband farm.</p>
<p>Her unique clay work is inspired by the beauty of the ever-changing landscape. The layers of natural elements reflecting the textures, colours and patterns in nature. She forms each piece by hand, echoing the diversity in nature as no two things are exactly the same. Each piece is a celebration of nature’s effortless splendor. Marney continues to refine her artistic skills as an artist, pushing the boundaries of clay.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Marney has received many awards and has been commissioned by both private and corporate collectors. Her work can be found in Canada and around the world.</p>
<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p>Clay is my passion.</p>
<p>An element from the earth that is soft and supple but can withstand
intense heat, transforming it to become strong and hard. It requires
patience, for the process is ever changing. You cannot see the end at the
beginning, your vision is only brought to light after the last firing.
My pieces are a reflection of the beauty of the landscape. The exploration
of color, texture and patterns have all been instrumental in the
development of my work. I want to draw you in to the innate simplicity and
intricacies of nature. To capture its effortless splendor.</p>
<p>The vessel is my canvas, the backdrop to each handmade flower, branch
or stone. The natural elements pushing and pulling at its functionality.
Perhaps, the vessel now holds something more.</p>
<p>I create to inspire, stir an emotion, evoke a memory……feed the soul.</p>
