      <p>Marney is a third generation Albertan, born and raised in the Millarville area south of Calgary. She graduated with distinction from the Alberta College of Art majoring in ceramics. She is a full&mdahs;time working artist focusing her attention on drawing and sculpting clay. Marney lives with her husband and two children on a farm south of Fort Macleod, Alberta. She is inspired by the beauty of the landscape. Seasonal changes in textures, patterns and colours have been instrumental in the development of her drawings and clay work. Her clay pots reflect this diversity in nature &mdash; no two pots are alike. She forms each unique piece completely by hand. Marney continues to explore and refine her skills as an artist honouring nature and the agricultural community.</p>

      <p>Throughout her career, Marney has received many awards. Her work has been featured on the cover of the Charolais Banner Magazine and her work was selected as the logo for the North American Seed Fair. She has been commissioned by both corporate and private collectors. Her work has been previously showcased at the Calgary Stampede Art Auction and has been sold in Canada and around the world including New Zealand, England, Denmark, Mexico, Japan and the United States.</p>
